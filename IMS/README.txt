A multi-screen JavaFX application inventory management system. This application stores data inputed by the user while allowing the data to be recalled for modification.
Data is managed in tables with add, modify, and delete buttons to manage said data. Data is categorized into parts and products. Parts can be added to the parts table and
then applied to added products as associated parts. The application validates user inputed values before adding or modifying the data. The application does not utilize a
database so data will not persist.
